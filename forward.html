    With regards to the issue of the public and their thoughts towards this lack of diversity and proper representation in Apple’s workforce, the words of an Apple stakeholder, Tony Maldonado, perfectly describe the issue. "The more this becomes public and the more they provide pushback and resistance to this, then the people will happily shop somewhere else." This means that market share will be lost and this will be detrimental for Apple’s profitability, especially from the non-white population that feel mistreated and underrepresented. With regards to the term “pushback” being used, Apple argues that it already has "much broader" diversity efforts at work and, in the past three years, has made "steady progress in attracting more women and underrepresented minorities." Maldonado is leading an effort to mandate that Apple accelerate its work toward becoming a more diverse company. For the second year in a row, he's submitted a shareholder proposal asking that Apple "adopt an accelerated recruitment policy ... to increase the diversity of senior management and its board of directors." The keyword here is “accelerated”, it is evident that Apple is making steps towards addressing the diversity issue, but these steps are small and must increase in size in order for Apple to catch up to what is acceptable in terms of diversity in this day and age. “Apple, of course, is a large company, with 130,000 employees worldwide and 83,000 in the U.S. It’s a large company with high retention rates, sources say.” Obviously, with low turnover rates, it is hard for a company to address issues within their workforce, such as diversity, at a fast rate. “Apple is (also) leaning too heavily on retail stores to improve its diversity figures while doing little at the senior level (82 percent of Apple's leadership is white, versus only 56 percent of its retail employees).” This issue may also break down to the fact that turnover rates at senior positions are slower, however, it does bring to question the methods behind Apple’s improvement in their diversity. Senior management is the face of the company and includes the people that make the large company decisions, and currently these people are not collectively diverse, and lag far behind their retail numbers in terms of diversity as well. 
Maldonado also states: "I dug into it and saw Apple has rarely ever had many people of ethnic or racial diversity within their board or senior leadership," he says. For a 40-year-old company “that’s laughable. That's racism plain and simple. That's all it is. There has to be plenty of people with sufficient qualifications.” For a stakeholder of the company itself, this speaks volumes to the current performance of the company in terms of addressing diversity in their workforce. "The board and their leadership needs to expand their viewpoints, and only by allowing others to come in to provide them their insight will (Apple then) be able to tackle those challenge." This quote moves towards the potential benefits that Apple could reap with having a more diverse workforce. As already demonstrated with the BCG study and The National Center for Women and Information Technology, it is undeniable that Apple should pay more attention to accelerating their diversity increases in order to drive their company forward.
Due to the low turnover rate that exists within Apple’s ranks, we believe that it may be necessary for Apple to expand the amount of upper management positions that exist in order to open up opportunities for the company to expand its diversification.
Apple considers itself a leader in the technology industry. Hence, as such it should also push the technology industry towards greater diversity. Therefore, we propose an integrated web-based platform to increase diversity in the Apple and, in the future, the whole technology industry. This platform will be built for high school minorities currently in the 10th, 11th and 12th grade. It will be since grade 10 as it has been shown that early engagement is key towards the development of minorities in the technology industry. 
The platform will serve as a bridge of communication between students and Apple (an in the future other technology companies). Through the platform, students will be able to apply for job postings, contact recruiters (which specialize in diversity inclusion) and communicate with prominent minority figures in the technology industry. This will in turn motivate and engage with minorities from a young age and attract their talents towards the technology industry.
