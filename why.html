        Throughout the last 10 years, technology companies have tried to find the cause of diversity issues within themselves. Nevertheless, research has found that the lack of diversity in the technology industry is a combination of many effects coinciding. This means that there is no one single issue that causes the lack of diversity in the technology industry. Rather, several, non-quantifiable, aspects play a role in the lack of diversity. For example,  a recent research study that was conducted on young african american males and females has shown that racial stereotyping and bias play an important role in the development and inclusion of african american males and females (McGee, 2013). This type of issue is difficult to quantify for technology companies, and therefore difficult to assess or fix. This type of stereotyping can be performed by several members of technology companies that come in contact with job applicants. For example, recruiters or advisors. One such act may be the recruiter disregarding an african american male’s resume because of his race. Similarly, a USA Today study found that women and minorities have been denied early access to tools and resources that would allow them to succeed in the technology sector (Weise, 2018). This means that women and minorities do not have access to opportunities such as AP Computer Science courses or technical job fairs early in their career. This is in contrast to the highest demography in the technology sector, white males; because they often come from privileged high schools who have the opportunity to offer such courses and materials. 

In contrast, Sheryl Sandberg (Facebook COO), has said that the actual problem stems from the lack of outreach that the technology industry provides to women and minorities. Sandberg advocates for more strong female and minority figures in the industry. This, she argues, would provide role models to young minorities and encourage them to pursue a career in the technology industry. She also emphasizes the need to engage with these minorities, as most technology companies fail to implement outreach programs that truly progress in the tech industry. That is, not just hiring minorities to meet diversity goals. But rather actively pursue diversification plans by directly contacting, and engaging, with minorities.

      So why should Apple be concerned about this diversity issue anyways? Well, it has been evident in multiple studies and business settings that diversity aids a company in productivity and profitability.

“The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) has found that diversity increases the bottom line for companies. The study found that "increasing the diversity of leadership teams leads to more and better innovation and improved financial performance." It looked at 1700 different companies across 8 different countries, with varying industries and company sizes. Companies that have more diverse management teams have 19% higher revenue due to innovation.” The BCG is a reputable management consulting firm that operates in over 50 countries. This study clearly demonstrates from the extent of companies evaluated the importance of diversity towards profitability and innovation. For those unclear, the bottom line refers to the net income of the company after a certain financial period. “The National Center for Women & Information Technology (also) conducted a study of 2,360 communities in multiple industries and found that “companies with women on their executive boards outperformed companies with all-male executive boards.” This study demonstrates the importance of gender representation at the upper levels of management within a company. Lastly, expanding viewpoints through staff diversification can provide international insight and allow for a better customer-company relationship. It is important for Apple to realize this, and take into consideration the benefits that are proven to happen with a properly diverse company. 

With regards to the issue of the public and their thoughts towards this lack of diversity and proper representation in Apple’s workforce, the words of an Apple stakeholder, Tony Maldonado, perfectly describe the issue. "The more this becomes public and the more they provide pushback and resistance to this, then the people will happily shop somewhere else." This means that market share will be lost and this will be detrimental for Apple’s profitability, especially from the non-white population that feel mistreated and underrepresented. With regards to the term “pushback” being used, Apple argues that it already has "much broader" diversity efforts at work and, in the past three years, has made "steady progress in attracting more women and underrepresented minorities." Maldonado is leading an effort to mandate that Apple accelerate its work toward becoming a more diverse company. For the second year in a row, he's submitted a shareholder proposal asking that Apple "adopt an accelerated recruitment policy ... to increase the diversity of senior management and its board of directors." The keyword here is “accelerated”, it is evident that Apple is making steps towards addressing the diversity issue, but these steps are small and must increase in size in order for Apple to catch up to what is acceptable in terms of diversity in this day and age. “Apple, of course, is a large company, with 130,000 employees worldwide and 83,000 in the U.S. It’s a large company with high retention rates, sources say.” Obviously, with low turnover rates, it is hard for a company to address issues within their workforce, such as diversity, at a fast rate. “Apple is (also) leaning too heavily on retail stores to improve its diversity figures while doing little at the senior level (82 percent of Apple's leadership is white, versus only 56 percent of its retail employees).” This issue may also break down to the fact that turnover rates at senior positions are slower, however, it does bring to question the methods behind Apple’s improvement in their diversity. Senior management is the face of the company and includes the people that make the large company decisions, and currently these people are not collectively diverse, and lag far behind their retail numbers in terms of diversity as well.
